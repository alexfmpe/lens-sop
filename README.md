This library contains a definition of generalized lenses, along with SOP-style
generic functions (based on [generics-sop][1]) that compute lenses for a given
record type. Generalized lenses for the SOP representation types are also
provided.

Furthermore, a generic function is provided that computes a lens from a given
(string-based) path specification.

This is the development repository. For releases, look on [Hackage][2].
