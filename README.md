This library contains a definition of generalized lenses that are built on
top of the [fclabels][0] package.

It also contains SOP-style generic functions (based on the
[generics-sop][1] package) that compute lenses for a given record type.
Generalized lenses for the SOP representation types are also provided.

Furthermore, a generic function is provided that computes a lens from a
given (string-based) path specification.

This is the development repository. For releases, look on [Hackage][2].
